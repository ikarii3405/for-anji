				<p class="ay">you feel like a dream

					a dream that i've always wanted, but also a dream that I can wake up to anytime.
					
					it's scary how people come into your life and anytime, they might go.
					
					life is so unpredictable, and maybe that's why i'm scared because even if we loved each other so much, if you weren't meant to stay then nothing in this universe could make you stay.
					
					i know people come and go, but please not you</p>
